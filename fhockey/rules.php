            Fantasy Hockey, Game of Kings&trade;, may be played by any active member of the University of Sheffield Hockey Club. Old boys/birds may also enter teams but are inelligable for prizes.</p>
        <p>
            To create a team, please <strong>Log In</strong> and return to the main <a href="./fhockey.php">fantasy hockey section</a> of the website. On the left is a link to "Create a Team". Follow this link and fill out the form.</p>
            <p>A Fantasy Hockey Team consists of:
                <ul>
                <li>1 Goalkeeper</li>
                <li>4 Defenders</li>
                <li>4 Midfielders</li>
                <li>2 Forwards</li>
                </ul>
            </p>
            <p>
            A team may cost no more than <strong>&pound;50m</strong>. Players are valued on their captains ranking from last year added to the number of goals scored (conceeded for defenders). All freshers are valued at <strong>&pound;4m</strong> (bargain!) at the start of the season but will increase in value as they find their place in the club.<br />
            There are no restrictions on who you buy, male or female. Everyone earns points in the same way.
            </p>
            <p>
            A player scores points every time a match is played. A player (and team's) points are updated automatically when a match report is submitted. Points are awarded as follows:
            <ul>
            <li>All players score <strong>1</strong> point for appearing (in the squad)</li>
            <li>A Goalkeeper scores <strong>10</strong> points for keeping a clean sheet</li>
            <li>A Goalkeeper loses <strong>1</strong> point for each goal they conceed</li>
            <li>A Defender scores <strong>3</strong> points for keeping a clean sheet</li>
            <li>A Defender loses <strong>1</strong> point for each goal they conceed</li>
            <li>A Defender scores <strong>10</strong> points for each goal they score</li>
            <li>A Midfielder scores <strong>7</strong> points for each goal they score</li>
            <li>A Forward scores <strong>5</strong> points for each goal they score</li>
            <li>The Man/Woman of the Match scores an additional <strong>10</strong> points</li>
            <li>Any player recieving a yellow card loses <strong>10</strong> points</li>
            <li>Any player recieving a red card loses <strong>50</strong> points</li>
            </ul>
            </p>
            <p>
            All friendly matches (non-BUSA) do not count towards your points totals. Mens 6s intra-mural games will only count if a goalkeeper is present on both sides (highly unlikely)
            </p>
            <p>
                You may make up to 3 transfers per season. Beware, freshers may be cheap to start with but will dramatically increase (or decrease) in value later on.
            </p>
            <p>
                Team submissions will open <strong>after the first week's friendly games</strong>. Until then, dabble with the team creator and pick your favorites. If a player is  missing from the list, send them a message and tell them to put their favoured playing position in their profile, cos ya can't be picked without it!</p>
