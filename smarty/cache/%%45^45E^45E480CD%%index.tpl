    <h2><a href="./newsdetails.php?article_id=268">FOUR WEEKS TO GO!</a></h2>
    <em>By <a href="./viewprofile.php?action=view&amp;uid=324">Swede</a> on Jun 27, 2007 in News</em>
    <p>Its only four weeks to go until the biggest weekend of the summer and preparations are well underway! <br />
<br />
It would help us all alot if you could get teams in asap or even let one of us know numbers of teams so we have a rough idea of how many people are coming? <br />
<br />
SHITS certainly is something not to be missed, it will be a great weekend and a good chance to catch up with everyone!<br />
<br />
See you all then,<br />
<br />
Swede and CO x</p>

    <p>Hey guys!<br />
<br />
hope all of your exams have gone/are going well, only just recvovered from my end of degree party on Mon!<br />
<br />
Right here's the plan:<br />
<br />
for everyone who's free, tonight 7.30 South Sea for a drinking game social!<br />
<br />
the idea is to get people a bit better aquainted with all the many drinking games that you may not be familiar with, so that for next yr you can take the lead and show the new freshers just how good the hockey club is!<br />
<br />
plus...the more we play the drunker we get ;)<br />
<br />
its my last Juice :'( so it'd be really good to see as many of you as possible!<br />
<br />
hope to see you there...<br />
<br />
Plug x x x<br />
<br />
p.s. the theme for juice is beach, so if you fancy it, get you boardies on!<br />
